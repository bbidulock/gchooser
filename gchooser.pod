=head1 NAME

gchooser - A GTK2-perl XDMCP Host chooser replacement.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 /usr/lib/X11/xdm/gchooser [options] {ADDRESSES ...}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gchooser> is a GTK2-perl replacement for the horribly ugly Athena Widget Set
chooser that comes with Xorg X Display Manager.  It is designed to let L<xdm(1)>
do the heavy lifting of coordinating the majority of the XDMCP protocol while
providing a more aesthetic appearance.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item I<ADDRESSES ...>

Provides the human-readable (decimal and dot notation, host names) specification
of the display managers to query to determine whether they are willing to manage
a display.  In additional to all manner of textual IP addresses, the special
value C<BROADCAST> can be specified to indicate to the chooser that it should
(also) broadcast queries to discover display managers.

=head1 OPTIONS

No options are necessary.  When launched by L<xdm(1)>, it will provide the
appropriate arguments.  B<gchooser> can be launched directly on the command line
of an x-terminal to test its appearance and operation.  In this mode arguments
are still required but no options.

=over 4

=item B<-banner> I<PNGFILE>

Specifies the banner graphic to display in the left pane of the host menu.
L<xdm(1)> does not provide this option, but it can easily be invoked by a
a shell script invoked by L<xdm(1)> that adds the options.  For example:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/lib/X11/xdm/gchooser -banner /usr/lib/X11/xdm/banner.png $@

=item B<-welcome> I<TEXT>

Specifies the pango markup text that is to be displayed in the title area
of the host menu.  As with the B<-banner> option, this option can easily be
supplied by a shell script between L<xdm(1)> and B<gchooser> that adds the
options:

 #!/bin/sh
 /usr/lib/X11/xdm/gchooser -welcome "Welcome to X!" \
	 -banner /usr/lib/X11/xdm/banner.png $@

=item B<-xdmaddress> I<ADDRESS>

Specifies the address of a TCP socket upon which L<xdm(1)> is awaiting instructions
for the server.  L<xdm(1)> encodes this as I<ADDRESS> as a string of hexadecimal
characters (with no 0x prefix) representing the binary socket address.  The
first two bytes are a host-byte-order 16-bit address family (e.g. AF_INET);
the second and third bytes are the host-byte-order 16-bit port number; and
the remaining 4 or 16 bytes are the IPv4 or IPv6 network-byte-order IP
address.

B<gchooser> uses this option to communicate the selection back to L<xdm(1)>.

=item B<-clientaddress> I<IPADDR>

Specifies the client IP address I<IPADDR> that initiated the request.  L<xdm(1)>
encodes this as a string of hexadecimal characters (with no 0x prefix)
representing the 4- or 16-byte IPv4 or IPv6 network-byte-order IP address.

B<gchooser> uses this option to identify the originating client back to
L<xdm(1)> when a selection is made.

=item B<-connectionType> I<TYPE>

Specifies the connection type supported by the client as a decimal number,
I<TYPE>.

B<gchooser> uses this option to filter the list of willing display managers to
those that suport this connection type.  The three types of interest to
L<xdm(1)> (see F</usr/include/X11/Xdmcp.h> are:

=over 4

=item 0 - B<FamilyInternet> (AF_INET addresses only)

=item 6 - B<FamilyInternet6> (AF_INET6 addresses only)

=item 256 - B<FamilyLocal> (AF_UNIX addresses only)

=back

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

B<gchooser> has no configuration of its own.  If you want to change its look
or behaviour, you are welcome to hack the script.  It is only about 600 lines
of perl.  There is F<banner.png> file used that is installed by default in
F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/banner.png>.

=over 4

=item B<DisplayManager>.I<DISPLAY>.B<chooser>

This option, described in L<xdm(1)>, is use to tell L<xdm(1)> which program to
run as a chooser.  This should be set to F</usr/lib/X11/xdm/gchooser>.  See the
B<CHOOSER> section of the L<xdm(1)> manual page.
